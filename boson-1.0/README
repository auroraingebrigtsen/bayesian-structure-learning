BOSON (Bucket Order Scheme for Optimal Networks)

Copyright 2009, 2012 Pekka Parviainen <pekkapa(at)kth.se>

Software for exact learning of Bayesian network structures using parallel bucket order schemes.


Licence

This software is distributed under GNU GPL. See COPYING.


Compilation
===========

Compilation:

  make
  
Compiling has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) using g++ (version 4.6.3).


Usage
=====

Usage:

  .\boson [options]
  
For available options, see the parameters section below.

The first line of the input file should consist of the possible parent set coded as integers. Note that these must match the sets of size at most m, where m is the maximum indegree parameter (see, the next section). The following lines contain the local scores for each variable and possible parent set. See example.dat.


Parameters
==========

maximum indegree (-m)
  The maximum number of parents that a node can have. Default is 3.
  
bucket size (-s)
  The program uses (ceil(s/2) * floor(s/2)) bucket orders schemes. Default is 2.

number of parallel bucket orders (-p)
  Tells how many bucket orders (determined by s) are considered in parallel. Default is 0 (the standard dynamic programming algorithm).
  
data file (-d)  
  The name of the input data file. 


Examples
========

Run the program with the default parameters:

  ./boson -d example.data
  
Find an optimal network when example.dat contains scores for parent sets up to size 3 using 2 parallel (3*3) bucket orders:

  ./boson -d example.dat -m 4 -s 6 -p 2
